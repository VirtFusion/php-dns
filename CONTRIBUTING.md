First off, thank you for even considering contributing! All you need to contribute is curiousity, a helpful attitude, and a few extra things like:

- 100% unit test coverage. Test coverage isn't everything, but it's easy. Good test cases are much appreciated.
- Comply with PSR2 coding standards.
- Keep your solution as SOLID and simple as possible. 

Of course I am available to help and am open to your way of doing something. If you want to propose a radically different approach,
the best way to do it is in a PR with examples. It helps clear up any communication misunderstanding around your design.

Again, thank you so much for being interested in contributing.

Also, checkout the Makefile for useful goodies to get you up and running, coding, and testing.
