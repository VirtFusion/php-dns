# Code of Conduct

## Be Kind

We're all very different, and we're all human. What an amazing thing!

Every person is welcome here in so much as they do not seek to harass or dehumanize another one
on this project.

Always assume best intent. 

Strive for civility, kindness, helpfulness, and humility above all else.

In the words of the Author Kurt Vonnegut via Mr. Rosewater:

> Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It’s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you’ve got a hundred years here. There’s only one rule that I know of, babies—God damn it, you’ve got to be kind.
